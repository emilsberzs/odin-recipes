    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my four picky kids eat it â€” and I got my picture in the
        paper for it! If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas into quarters so they absorb the
        sauce better.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>18 tortillas</li>
        <li>garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 package cheese</li>
        <li>1 container cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no
            longer pink and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
            should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool, shred, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner using metal tongs until lightly
            puffed, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the bottom of a medium baking dish; arrange 6 tortillas in a single
            layer on top. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, and 1/3 of the
            remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining
            enchilada sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with any remaining enchilada
            sauce</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
